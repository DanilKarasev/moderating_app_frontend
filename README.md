# Moderating ads application
Presented app is an interface of moderating ads created by users. Ads being loaded by 10 pcs. To load a new list of ads, you have to make a decision of all 10's.

# Technical requirements
- Avoid react - redux
- Use hotkeys for each action
- Load ads by batches, 10 pcs each
- Action "Decline" should have commentary, "Escalate" can have one
- Any decision can be changed before being sent to the server
- Small backend app on Node, the main part is frontend

## Managing ads catalog:
Go in `/server` directory.

In `createDataList.js` you can find a function that makes ads. \
Default ads quantity:  `50`. \
To change ads quantity, you should change`adsQuantity` to whatever number you want.

To create catalog of ads run next command:
### `node createDataList`

\
Checked ads writes to `data/completedList.json` \
By default in `completedList.json` should be an `EMPTY ARRAY`

If elements in `completedList.json` equals to elements in `dataList.json` by id, then data will not be loaded, because all tasks are checked.

To restore app functionality just press `Clear All` button after checking all ads. 


## Starting local host:

Go into `/server` directory and run:

### `node start`

By default, localhost runs at http://localhost:8080 \
If you want to change port, just edit `"proxy"` parameter in `package.json`

### `npm i`

### `npm start`
